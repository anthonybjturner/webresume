	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		
		<div id="content">
			<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Anthony, and I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> major. I have been into computers for over 18 years. 
			Back then, I could never afford a computer, so I spent many hours over my friends' house, playing computer games with them. 
			I became more technically involved with computers when my mother bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank"> Commodore 64. </a></p>

				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				&nbsp;The C64 introduced me to the language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64#BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> and the popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto" target="_blank"> GOTO </a> command. 
			I found coding interesting, but when I relocated to a different house, I forgot about it. At that time, I did not have any no clue it would be my favorite hobby and carreer. 
			</p>  
			
			<p>&nbsp; Shortly after, thanks to the internet and message boards such as <a href="http://www.overclock.com" target="_blank"> Overclock.com </a> I built my first computer. 
				I ordered my parts from <a href="http://www.newegg.com" target="_blank">NewEgg</a>. The operating system at the time was Windows XP code name Luna.

		<h1>Yasuos' Quest - C++ Role Playing Game in development</h1>
		
		<div id="content">
			<p> I have started working on a RPG in C++. Creating an RPG is a really difficult task, but I had a lot of help from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Playing-DirectX-Development-Series/dp/159200315X" target="_blank">
				Programming Role Playing Games with DirectX.</a> I used some of the game logic code, but I swapped out any portions using 3D and DirectX and used 2D and <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/" target="_blank">SFML</a> instead. 
				The project has been really fun, and I really like game development and seeing my game start to mature. I taught my self a few design patterns during the software development cycle: 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern" target="_blank">Command Pattern</a>, 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" target="_blank">Observer Pattern</a>, 
				and 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern" target="_blank">State Pattern</a> (for this particular use, Game States).
