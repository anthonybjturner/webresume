		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		
		<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Anthony, and I'm a computer science major. I have been entertained and into computers for over 18 years. 
		Back then, I could never afford a computer, so I spent many hours over my friends' house, playing computer games with them. I was more technially
		introduced towards computers when my mother bought a Commodore 64. </p>

			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		With the C64, I was introduced to the language BASIC and the popular GOTO command. I found coding interesting, but when I relocated to 
		a different house. I forgot about it. I did not have any no clue about the impact it would have on my life years later. 
		</p>  
		<p>
		Currently, my passion is coding. Most of my at-home-time is spent with it.
